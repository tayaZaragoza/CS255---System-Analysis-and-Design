# CS255---System-Analysis-and-Design
The DriverPass project is for a client that wanted to help students pass their driving exam. They wanted a system that allows for students to take practice tests and learn how to drive by scheduling lessons. I feel I did well with fully summarizing the client's needs in the busines requirements document. If I could improve a portion of these documents, I would work more on my diagrams. I feel that they are underdeveloped and may be missing important elements. 
It's important to consider the user's needs when designing because you want to be sure that the system is user-friendly and efficient. For designing software, I find that bullet pointing the client requirements first always helps. Then you can design the system around the non-negotiable elements.
